# hello-world

This is Hector A. Arevalo, I'm just trying to understand how github works. I think this could be a great tool for taking care of versioning files, if it allows to o back to previous versions it will actually be useful to go back to any versions of a file that worked in the past. I see value on this tool specially using it for programming. Maybe with some designs in illustrator.
